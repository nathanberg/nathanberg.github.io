# Understanding the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The **MITRE ATT&CK** framework is a publicly available knowledge base of
adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It was
originally developed by the MITRE Corporation to help security professionals
better understand how attackers operate and how to detect or mitigate their
activities.

## What does ATT&CK stand for?

*Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge*. The framework catalogs
specific behaviors (techniques) that adversaries use to achieve goals (tactics),
along with references to real incidents where those behaviors were observed.

## Why is ATT&CK important?

1. **Threat Modeling** – Security teams can use ATT&CK to map out how an attacker
   might progress through the network and identify gaps in defenses.
2. **Detection Engineering** – By aligning detection rules with ATT&CK
   techniques, analysts gain better visibility into adversary behavior.
3. **Assessment and Reporting** – ATT&CK provides a common language to describe
   attacker actions, making incident reports consistent and easier to share.

## Core Components

The framework is organized into a matrix of tactics (the columns) and techniques
(the rows). Key categories include:

- **Initial Access** – How an attacker first breaks into a network. Common
  techniques here include spearphishing and exploiting public-facing
  applications.
- **Privilege Escalation** – Methods used to gain higher-level permissions once
  inside a system, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities or bypassing
  access controls.
- **Lateral Movement** – Techniques that allow an attacker to move from one host
  to another, often using valid credentials or remote services like SMB or RDP.
- **Command and Control** – Ways attackers maintain communication with
  compromised systems, often through malicious domains, IP addresses, or DNS
  tunneling.

In addition, each technique can be broken down into sub-techniques that provide
more granular descriptions. For example, `Credential Dumping` under the `Credential
Access` tactic includes sub-techniques for obtaining passwords from memory, the
registry, or other sources.

## Putting ATT&CK into Practice

To get started with ATT&CK:

1. **Map existing detections** – Review your current security tools and map
   alerts to ATT&CK techniques. This highlights coverage gaps.
2. **Simulate attacker behavior** – Use tools like the open-source CALDERA
   platform or manual red team exercises to reproduce common techniques.
3. **Prioritize defenses** – Focus on techniques most relevant to your
   environment. For instance, organizations with many Windows systems should
   prioritize coverage for `PowerShell` abuse and `Credential Dumping`.

## Continual Updates

MITRE updates the framework regularly based on new threat research. Keeping an
eye on those updates ensures your defenses remain aligned with the latest
adversary behaviors.

Ultimately, the MITRE ATT&CK framework empowers security teams with a structured
approach to understanding how attackers operate. By integrating ATT&CK into your
security program, you can improve detection, streamline incident response, and
better communicate threat information across your organization.

## Further Reading

- The [official MITRE ATT&CK website](https://attack.mitre.org/) contains the
  complete matrices, detailed technique descriptions, and references.
- MITRE's [ATT&CK Navigator](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/navigator)
  tool allows you to visualize your security coverage across different
  techniques.

Staying informed about emerging threats and understanding how they map to the
ATT&CK framework will keep your organization better prepared for the evolving
cybersecurity landscape.
