- **Observer**: Notes actions and comments for debriefing.
- **Recorder**: Documents key points and outcomes.

Make sure participants understand their roles well before the exercise. This clarity enhances their performance. A well-defined structure aids in achieving exercise objectives.

Assigning these roles also prepares the team for real-world incidents. It reflects genuine organizational functions and encourages seamless operation during actual events.

## Selecting and Creating Realistic Scenarios

Creating realistic scenarios is a cornerstone of a successful tabletop exercise. Scenarios must reflect genuine threats faced by your organization. This realism helps participants engage meaningfully.

Identify potential risks by reviewing past incidents and current threats. This review should include both internal and external risks. A diverse range of scenarios prepares teams for multiple possibilities.

When crafting scenarios, consider:

- **Common Cyber Threats**: Phishing, malware attacks, and data breaches.
- **Industry-Specific Risks**: Unique threats tied to your sector.
- **Insider Threats**: Potential vulnerabilities from within the organization.
- **Supply Chain Concerns**: Risks from third-party vendors.
