# Exploiting Ivanti Connect Secure RCE (CVE-2025-0282)

## Overview

A recently disclosed vulnerability in **Ivanti Connect Secure (CVE-2025-0282)** has revealed a **stack-based buffer overflow** that enables remote code execution (RCE) without authentication. This flaw, found in the VPN appliance’s handling of IF-T connections, raises significant concerns about enterprise security, especially for organizations relying on Ivanti for secure remote access.

In this post, we’ll break down the **root cause**, discuss the **stack layout**, and walk through **how exploitation could be achieved**. However, in the interest of responsible disclosure, we won’t be providing a fully weaponized proof of concept.

## Root Cause Analysis

At the core of this vulnerability is improper memory handling in **/home/bin/web**, the binary responsible for managing incoming HTTP and VPN protocol requests. Specifically, the issue lies in how the application processes the `clientCapabilities` parameter.

### The Critical Mistake

While the function responsible for handling these connections does attempt to use `strncpy()` instead of the unsafe `strcpy()`, the **incorrect size parameter** was passed. Instead of restricting input based on the destination buffer’s size, it mistakenly used the **input string’s length**. This means that **any input longer than 256 bytes will overwrite adjacent stack variables**—including the return address.

```c
clientCapabilities = getKey(req, "clientCapabilities");
if (clientCapabilities != NULL) {
    clientCapabilitiesLength = strlen(clientCapabilities);
    if (clientCapabilitiesLength != 0) {
        connInfo->clientCapabilities = clientCapabilities;
    }
}
memset(dest, 0, sizeof(dest));
strncpy(dest, connInfo->clientCapabilities, clientCapabilitiesLength);
```

The flaw is straightforward: the dest buffer is only 256 bytes, yet the function allows clientCapabilitiesLength to be greater than 256, causing an out-of-bounds write.

### Stack Layout and Control Flow

To understand how this overflow can be leveraged for exploitation, let’s examine the stack layout at the time of execution:
```
+---------------------+
| v18 (int)          |
+---------------------+
| v19 (int)          |
+---------------------+
| dest[256]          | <- Buffer Overflow Occurs Here
+---------------------+
| object_to_be_freed |
+---------------------+
| ptr (void *)       |
+---------------------+
| v20 (int)          |
+---------------------+
| v21 (int)          |
+---------------------+
| v22 (int)          |
+---------------------+
| v23 (char)         |
+---------------------+
| v24 (char)         |
+---------------------+
| v25 (void *)       |
+---------------------+
| v26[499]           |
+---------------------+
| Return Address     | <- Overwritten to Control Execution Flow
+---------------------+
```
Under normal conditions, an attacker could overwrite the return address and redirect execution to controlled shellcode or a ROP chain. However, there’s a problem—the function attempts to free a stack-allocated object before returning, which triggers a crash if the pointer has been corrupted.

### Exploitation Strategy

Leveraging VTables for Control
To avoid premature crashes, we can redirect execution via a virtual function table (vtable) pointer instead of directly overwriting the return address. This works by:

1. Overwriting the `this` pointer stored on the stack.
2. Redirecting it to a fake vtable placed in a controlled memory region.
3. Ensuring the virtual function at offset 0x48 points to a useful ROP gadget.
This technique allows us to bypass the function epilogue that would normally dereference invalid memory and cause a segmentation fault.

### Crafting a ROP Chain
Once control is established, the next step is building a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to achieve code execution. A typical approach might look like this:

```aiignore
mov_eax_esp_ret = p32(0xf29e92c3)   # mov eax, esp; ret
add_eax_8_ret = p32(0xf5068858)     # add eax, 8; ret;
pop_esi_ret = p32(0xf4f5de27)       # pop esi; ret;
esi = p32(0xf5a07d40)               # system
set_arg_call_esi = p32(0xf4f5e265)  # mov dword ptr [esp], eax; call esi;
```
This sequence sets up `system("/bin/sh")`, achieving remote shell access.

### Challenges and Mitigations
While this vulnerability is exploitable under the right conditions, certain defenses complicate exploitation:

- ASLR & PIE: The binary is position-independent, meaning addresses are randomized each execution.
- Stack Canaries: If enabled, canaries will detect buffer overflows before the return address is overwritten.
- Non-Executable Stack: Shellcode injection alone won’t work without ROP or JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming).

However, ASLR is limited in x86 architectures, making brute-force feasible in certain environments. A full exploit would require leaking memory addresses or brute-forcing ASLR offsets.

### Conclusion

This vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure (CVE-2025-0282) exposes a serious risk for organizations using the VPN appliance. While Ivanti has since released patches, the fact that such a fundamental buffer overflow was present in a mission-critical security product raises concerns.

This case underscores the importance of secure coding practices, proper memory handling, and proactive security testing. Enterprises should ensure:

Immediate patching of affected appliances.
Stronger security validation during product development.
Continuous security testing to catch these issues before attackers do.

### Take Action

If your organization uses Ivanti Connect Secure, ensure that:

- Firmware is updated to the latest version.
- Network segmentation prevents direct exposure of the VPN appliance.
- Anomaly detection is enabled for unexpected VPN activity.
